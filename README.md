# ErdosInstituteQuantitativeFinanceProjectFall2025

This project aims to compare and contrast ten stocks, seven of which are considered top of the line. Furthermore, the SPY stock, which is supposed to represent the S&P 500 is also used as a separate 'ticker'. The Merton Jump Diffusion methodology was used. Delta Hedging and Black Scholes are used to compare and constrast such stocks with respect to the American Option.
